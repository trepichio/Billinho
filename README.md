## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

This is a simple REST API that demonstrate CRUD capabilities to manage Students' course enrollments and their bills, authenticate users, and persist data on any database supported by [Sequelize](http://sequelize.org/).

The purpose of doing this project was a requested exam from a company that I had a job interview, and also, sure, learn more about technologies and stack involved on it.

In this project, particularly, I've got a struggle to make 'delete on cascade' working as I did choose to use Paranoid (Sofdeletes). I'm glady that after reading a lot on web (Google, Stackoverflow and Medium are always helpful) it did work! üòÑüòé

I appreciated the opportunity of doing this small project and hope it will be useful somehow to anyone out there.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Before you read further <a name = "before_read_further"></a>

I let all CRUD in the public routes INTENTIONALLY. This is for making easier and quickier an demonstration during job interview. That way I didn't need to worry about authenticating a user and needing to put the token in every request. Life is already hard enough, let this one make mine better. ü§£ü§£

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes..

### Prerequisites

You need a database server installed and running on your local machine.
I've used [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org) on this project.

Then, you can use a default user `postgres` and database `postgres` or create and use your own. It's up to you.

After that, it's time to setup the project.

### Installing

Clone this repository to your local machine.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/trepichio/Billinho/Billinho.git
```

Enter the root folder of the cloned project.
Rename `.env.example` file to `.env` and input them as values of their respectives variables in the .env file

The variables are pretty much self-explanatory.

Install dependecies. In your terminal, run:

```
$ npm install
```

Now, you have to migrate the tables to database.
At the root of project folder, run:

```
$ node_modules/.bin/sequelize db:migrate
```

then, seed data to the tables.

```
$ node_modules/.bin/sequelize db:seed:all
```

### Running
You are ready to go:

```
$ npm start
```

Now, you can use any REST Client you like and consume any of API endpoints such as

```
GET http://localhost:3000/pub/instituicoes?page=1&limit=4 HTTP/1.1.
```

If you use Visual Code there is a very useful extension that works like a REST Client. See [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client).

In case, you decided to go and use this extension, enjoy the `request.rest` file I've already done for you. Enjoy! üòé
